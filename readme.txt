MajorClarity Technical Exercise

Your product owner is asking you to implement a new feature in the calendar system
that is in your scheduling tool. The feature needs to support arranging a set of
meetings within an 8 hour day in a way that makes them work, and let the user know
if the meetings cannot fit into the day.
For this feature there will be two kinds of meetings, on-site meetings and off-site
meetings. On-site meetings can be scheduled back to back with no gaps in between
them, but off-site meetings must have 30 minutes of travel time padded to either
end. This travel time however can overlap for back to back off-site meetings, and can
extend past the start and end of the day.

Given a set of meetings (below is an example of a set of meetings):
{
{ name: “Meeting 1”, duration: 3, type: :onsite },
{ name: “Meeting 2”, duration: 2, type: :offsite },
{ name: “Meeting 3”, duration: 1, type: :offsite },
{ name: “Meeting 4”, duration: 0.5, type: :onsite }
}

You must write code to determine if these meetings can fit into a 9 to 5 schedule,
and propose a layout for those meetings in a format like this:
9:00 - 12:00 - Meeting 1
12:00 - 12:30 - Meeting 4
1:00 - 3:00 - Meeting 2
3:30 - 4:30 - Meeting 3

Here are a few example sets for you to test against:

Example 1:
{
{ name: “Meeting 1”, duration: 1.5, type: :onsite },
{ name: “Meeting 2”, duration: 2, type: :offsite },
{ name: “Meeting 3”, duration: 1, type: :onsite },
{ name: “Meeting 4”, duration: 1, type: :offsite },
{ name: “Meeting 5”, duration: 1, type: :offsite },
}

Yes, can fit. One possible solution would be:
9:00 - 10:30 - Meeting 1
10:30 - 11:30 - Meeting 3
12:00 - 1:00 - Meeting 5
1:30 - 2:30 - Meeting 4
3:00 - 5:00 - Meeting 2

Example 2:
{
{ name: “Meeting 1”, duration: 4, type: :offsite },
{ name: “Meeting 2”, duration: 4, type: :offsite }
}

No, can’t fit.

Example 3:
{
{ name: “Meeting 1”, duration: 0.5, type: :offsite },
{ name: “Meeting 2”, duration: 0.5, type: :onsite },
{ name: “Meeting 3”, duration: 2.5, type: :offsite },
{ name: “Meeting 4”, duration: 3, type: :onsite }
}

Yes, can fit. One possible solution would be:
9:00 - 9:30 - Meeting 2
10:00 - 10:30 - Meeting 1
11:00 - 2:00 - Meeting 4
2:30 - 5:00 - Meeting 3

Instructions
. Write the solution in Ruby.
. Put the code up on Github, Bitbucket, etc…
. Commit early and often so we can see progress as you work through the solution.
. No need to create a complex UI, just a command line application is enough.
. The data samples can be hardcoded into the solution, no need to read in external
data.
